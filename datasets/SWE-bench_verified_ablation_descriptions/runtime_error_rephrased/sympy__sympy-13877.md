Matrix determinant raises Invalid NaN comparison with particular symbolic entries
    >>> from sympy import *
    >>> from sympy.abc import a
    >>> f = lambda n: det(Matrix([[i + a*j for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]))
    >>> f(1)
    0
    >>> f(2)
    -a
    >>> f(3)
    2*a*(a + 2) + 2*a*(2*a + 1) - 3*a*(2*a + 2)
    >>> f(4)
    0
    >>> f(5)
    nan
    >>> f(6)
    The computation fails because during the Bareiss determinant algorithm a NaN value is introduced in a coefficient comparison, leading to a TypeError about an invalid NaN comparison.
Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't the Bareiss algorithm only valid for integer matrices, which cannot be assumed here?
