## Task Objective
You are given a software issue description that may include both:
1. Detailed reproduction steps or executable test code, along with the expected output.
2. Executable code that triggers a runtime error, including the corresponding error message or stack trace.

Your task is to rewrite **only** the runtime error-related portion — turning it into a natural language explanation that a human developer might give when describing what went wrong.

## Issue Description
Accessing chunks on zarr backed xarray seems to load entire array into memory

### What happened?

When running the following example it appears the entire dataset is loaded into memory when accessing the `chunks` attribute:

```python
import xarray as xr

url = "https://ncsa.osn.xsede.org/Pangeo/pangeo-forge/swot_adac/FESOM/surf/fma.zarr"
ds = xr.open_dataset(url, engine='zarr') # note that ds is not chunked but still uses lazy loading
ds.chunks
```

### What did you expect to happen?

According to @rabernat accessing the chunks attribute should simply inspect the `encoding` attribute on the underlying DataArrays.

### Minimal Complete Verifiable Example

_No response_

### Relevant log output

When `ds.chunks` is accessed, xarray ends up reading the entire Zarr array from the remote store instead of just inspecting metadata. Under the hood, it tries to convert each variable’s data into a NumPy array to check for a `.chunks` attribute. This forces Zarr (via fsspec) to fetch all chunk files over the network, causing the operation to hang until the user interrupts with a KeyboardInterrupt.

### Anything else we need to know?

_No response_
