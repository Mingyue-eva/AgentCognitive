Union queryset with ordering breaks on ordering with derived querysets

Simple reproduction (the exact models are not relevant I think):
>>> Dimension.objects.values_list('id', flat=True)
<QuerySet [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]>
>>> qs = (
	Dimension.objects.filter(pk__in=[10, 11])
	.union(Dimension.objects.filter(pk__in=[16, 17])
	.order_by('order')
)
>>> qs
<QuerySet [<Dimension: boeksoort>, <Dimension: grootboek>, <Dimension: kenteken>, <Dimension: activa>]>
# this causes re-evaluation of the original qs to break
>>> qs.order_by().values_list('pk', flat=True)
<QuerySet [16, 11, 10, 17]>
>>> qs
When attempting to display the queryset again, it raises a ProgrammingError: ORDER BY position 4 is not in select list. The generated SQL includes ORDER BY (4) ASC, but the fourth column isnâ€™t in the SELECT clause, so the database rejects the query.
Evaluating the qs instead of creating a new qs makes the code proceed as expected.
