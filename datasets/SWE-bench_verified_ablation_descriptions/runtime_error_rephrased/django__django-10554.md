Union queryset with ordering breaks on ordering with derived querysets

Simple reproduction (the exact models are not relevant I think):
>>> Dimension.objects.values_list('id', flat=True)
<QuerySet [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]>
>>> qs = (
	Dimension.objects.filter(pk__in=[10, 11])
	.union(Dimension.objects.filter(pk__in=[16, 17])
	.order_by('order')
)
>>> qs
<QuerySet [<Dimension: boeksoort>, <Dimension: grootboek>, <Dimension: kenteken>, <Dimension: activa>]>
# this causes re-evaluation of the original qs to break
>>> qs.order_by().values_list('pk', flat=True)
<QuerySet [16, 11, 10, 17]>
>>> qs
When attempting to display the queryset again, it raises a ProgrammingError: ORDER BY position 4 is not in select list. The generated SQL includes ORDER BY (4) ASC, but the fourth column isn’t in the SELECT clause, so the database rejects the query.
Evaluating the qs instead of creating a new qs makes the code proceed as expected.
