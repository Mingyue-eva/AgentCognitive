I have an erroneous unique_together constraint on a model's primary key (unique_together = (('id',),)) that cannot be dropped by a migration. When the migration attempts to remove the unique constraint on the id column, it detects both the primary key and the additional unique constraint and fails because it only anticipates a single constraint to remove. Database is PostgreSQL, if that makes any difference.
