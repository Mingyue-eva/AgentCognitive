Exception when multiplying BlockMatrix containing ZeroMatrix blocks
When a block matrix with zero blocks is defined

```
>>> from sympy import *
>>> a = MatrixSymbol("a", 2, 2)
>>> z = ZeroMatrix(2, 2)
>>> b = BlockMatrix([[a, z], [z, z]])
```

then block-multiplying it once seems to work fine:

```
>>> block_collapse(b * b)
Matrix([
[a**2, 0],
[0, 0]])
>>> b._blockmul(b)
Matrix([
[a**2, 0],
[0, 0]])
```

but block-multiplying it a third time triggers an AttributeError: the collapse routine ends up trying to access the `cols` attribute of a plain `Zero` object, because the zero blocks produced by the intermediate multiplication are instances of `Zero` rather than `ZeroMatrix`. Since `Zero` has no `cols` attribute, the operation fails.

This seems to be caused by the fact that the zeros in `b._blockmul(b)` are not `ZeroMatrix` but `Zero`:

```
>>> type(b._blockmul(b).blocks[0, 1])
<class 'sympy.core.numbers.Zero'>
```

However, I don't understand SymPy internals well enough to find out why this happens. I use Python 3.7.4 and sympy 1.4 (installed with pip).
