Contains.as_set returns Contains
```py
>>> Contains(x, Reals).as_set()
Contains(x, Reals)
```

This is wrong because Contains is not a set (it's a boolean). It results in failures in other places because it doesn't have as_relational (since it isn't a set). For instance, when constructing Piecewise((6, Contains(x, Reals)), (7, True)), the code attempts to call `c = c.as_set().as_relational(x)` inside `Piecewise.eval`, but since `Contains.as_set()` still returns a `Contains` object without an `as_relational` method, it raises an AttributeError indicating that `'Contains' object has no attribute 'as_relational'`.
