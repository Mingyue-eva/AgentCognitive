Migrations uses value of enum object instead of its name.

Description

When using an Enum object as a default value for a CharField, the generated migration file uses the value of the Enum object instead of its name. This causes a problem when using Django translation on the value of the Enum object. When the Enum object value gets translated to the user's language, the old migration files raise an error stating that the Enum does not have the corresponding value (because the Enum value is translated to another language).

ValueError: 'Good' is not a valid Status

Shouldn't the code generated by the migration use the name of the Status Enum rather than its value, since it is changeable?
