## Issue Description
Please support header rows in RestructuredText output

### Description

In an interactive Python session, I import QTable from astropy.table, astropy.units as u, and sys. I then build a QTable with two columns: “wave” holding values 350 nm and 950 nm, and “response” holding counts 0.7 and 1.2. When I write this table to standard output using format="ascii.rst", it prints a simple reStructuredText table with a single header row showing the column names and the two data rows beneath. If I switch to format="ascii.fixed_width" and pass header_rows=["name", "unit"], I get two header rows—one for the column names and one for the units—followed by the data. However, as soon as I try to use the same header_rows argument with format="ascii.rst", the code fails with the following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):

### Additional context

RestructuredText output is a great way to fill autogenerated documentation with content, so having this flexible makes the life easier `:-)`
