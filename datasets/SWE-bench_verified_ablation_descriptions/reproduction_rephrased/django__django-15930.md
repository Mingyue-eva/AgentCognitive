Case() crashes with ~Q(pk__in=[]).  
Description  

A developer constructs a Django queryset that annotates each User with a boolean field named `_a`, using a Case expression that returns True when the userâ€™s primary key is not in an empty list and False otherwise. The queryset is then ordered by this annotation in descending order, and only the `pk` values are retrieved.  

The error is:  
ProgrammingError: syntax error at or near "THEN"  
LINE 1: ..._user"."id" FROM "users_user" ORDER BY CASE WHEN THEN true ...  
The generated SQL is:  
SELECT "users_user"."id" FROM "users_user" ORDER BY CASE WHEN THEN True ELSE False END ASC  
I expected behavior to annotate all rows with the value True since they all match.  
Relevant because ~Q(pkin=[]) is a sentinel value that is sometimes returned by application code.
