bad-names-rgxs mangles regular expressions with commas

### Bug description

Since pylint splits on commas in this option, instead of taking a list of strings, if there are any commas in the regular expression, the result is mangled before being parsed. The config below demonstrates this clearly by causing pylint to crash immediately.

### Configuration

```ini
[tool.pylint.basic]
# capture group ensures that the part after the comma is an invalid regular
# expression, causing pylint to crash
bad-name-rgxs = "(foo{1,3})"
```

### Command used

```shell
pylint foo.py
```

### Expected behavior

I would expect any valid regular expression to be expressible in this option. If not directly, adding some way to escape commas so that this issue can be worked around.

### Pylint version

```shell
pylint 2.14.4
astroid 2.11.7
Python 3.10.4 (main, Apr  2 2022, 09:04:19) [GCC 11.2.0]
```
