aggregate() with 'default' after annotate() crashes.

Description

I saw this on a PostgreSQL project and reproduced it with SQLite. Django 4.0.1. Annotate then aggregate works fine, but adding the aggregate classesâ€™ default argument (new in 4.0) breaks. The long form using Coalesce works as expected.
