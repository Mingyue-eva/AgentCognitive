Unicode method names cause UnicodeDecodeError for some requests in Python 2.7.2. Using a unicode value for the HTTP method appears to “infect” the headers with unicode instead of native strings. This behavior seems to originate from the line in sessions.py where req.method is set via method.upper(). I’m using requests 1.2.3 and the current source still employs the same .upper() call.
