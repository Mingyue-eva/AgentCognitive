unittest.TestCase.tearDown executed on skipped tests when running --pdb

I would have expected the test to be skipped, even with `--pdb`. With `pytest==5.4.1`, test was also skipped with `--pdb`, so this seem something that have changes between 5.4.2 and 5.4.1.

(I would have loved to, but I don't have time to send a PR these days)
