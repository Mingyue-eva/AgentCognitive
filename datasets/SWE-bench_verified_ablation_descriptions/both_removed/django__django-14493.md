ManifestStaticFilesStorage crashes with max_post_process_passes = 0.

substitutions is only set if the loop is entered at least once (see https://github.com/django/django/blob/a0a5e0f4c83acdfc6eab69754e245354689c7185/django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py#L246-L257). The motivation to set max_post_process_passes to 0 is to have Django not produce invalid CSS as described here: https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/21080#comment:19
