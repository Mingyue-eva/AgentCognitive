Migrations use the value of the Enum object instead of its name. When an Enum is used as the default for a CharField, Django generates a migration that refers to the Enum by its translated value rather than its constant name. Because the translated value can change based on the active language, applying old migrations can fail when the Enum no longer recognizes the translated string. Migrations should reference the Enum member by name (for example, Status['GOOD']) so that translations do not break existing migrations.
