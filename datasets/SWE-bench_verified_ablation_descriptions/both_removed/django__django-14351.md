Q object OR appears to get all related default columns and the queryset raises a “subquery must return only one column” error. There is a difference in how Q object aliases are set up when using agent__property_groups__in versus agent__property_groups__id__in: the former causes get_default_columns to include every field, while the latter includes only the id. This change in behavior worked in Django 2.2.5 but breaks in Django 3.2.
