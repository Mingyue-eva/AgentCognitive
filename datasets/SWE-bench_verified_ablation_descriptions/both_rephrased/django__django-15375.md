aggregate() with 'default' after annotate() crashes.

Description

I saw this on a PostgreSQL project and reproduced it with SQLite. Django 4.0.1.

I started a Django shell, imported the ORM functions and the Book model, and confirmed there are 95 entries in the Book table. I then annotated each record with its id and applied a sum aggregation on that field, which correctly returned 4560.

When I include the new default parameter on the Sum aggregation after the same annotation step, executing the query fails with an OperationalError indicating a syntax error near the FROM clause. The SQL generated by Django shows an empty SELECT list before the FROM keyword, causing the database error.

The “long form” using Coalesce works:
In [8]: Book.objects.annotate(idx=F("id")).aggregate(x=Coalesce(Sum("id"), 0))
Out[8]: {'x': 4560}
