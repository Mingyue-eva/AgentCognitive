is_subset gives wrong results  
@sylee957 Current status on master,

To reproduce the issue, create a finite set a containing the numbers 1 and 2, then form the Cartesian product b of a with itself. Next, define another finite set c consisting of the four ordered pairs (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1) and (2, 2). Verifying that the intersection of b with c equals the intersection of c with b returns True. However, when checking whether b is a subset of c and whether c is a subset of b, both calls return None instead of a boolean result.

When attempting to simplify the equality of b and c, the process fails with an AttributeError because an internal Complement object does not implement an equals method, causing the simplify operation to crash.

Finally, rewriting the product set b as a FiniteSet produces an unexpected output that represents the original set {1, 2} raised to the power of 2 rather than the expected set of ordered pairs.
