_pytest.capture.EncodedFile mode should not include `b` (binary)

<!--
Thanks for submitting an issue!

Here's a quick checklist for what to provide:
-->

- [x] a detailed description of the bug or suggestion

Exception when youtube-dl logs to pytest captured output. Youtube-dl looks for `b` in `out.mode` to decide whether to writes `bytes` or `str`. `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` incorrectly advertises `rb+`, the mode of the underlying stream. Its `write()` method raises an exception when passed `bytes`.

- [x] Steps to reproduce and expected outcome

To reproduce this issue, install pytest and youtube-dl in a fresh environment, create a test file that defines a single test function which imports youtube_dl and calls its extract_info method on any URL, and then run pytest against that file. You would expect the test to run without error and for youtube-dlâ€™s progress messages to appear normally.

- [x] What happened when the error occurred

When the test is run, pytest reports one collected item and then fails. The failure happens because youtube-dl writes a bytes object into the captured output stream, but the `_pytest.capture.EncodedFile` object, despite advertising a binary mode, only accepts text. As a result, a TypeError is raised stating that the write argument must be a string rather than bytes.
