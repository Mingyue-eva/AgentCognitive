Merging dataArray into dataset using dataset method fails  
While it's possible to merge a dataset and a dataarray object using the top-level merge() function, if you try the same thing with the ds.merge() method it fails.

To reproduce the issue, first create a dataset with a single variable named “a” set to zero. Then create a separate data array named “b” containing the value one. If you pass both the dataset and the data array to the global merge() function, you receive a combined dataset with both variables “a” and “b” as expected. However, if you invoke merge() as a method on the dataset object itself and pass in the data array, the operation does not complete successfully.

Expected result: In both cases, the dataset should be extended to include the new variable “b,” yielding a dataset with variables “a” and “b.”

When you call the dataset’s merge method with a data array argument, the code raises an attribute error at runtime. This happens because the merge implementation expects its input objects to behave like mappings with an items() method, but a data array does not provide that interface. As a result, the merge call fails and the data array is not incorporated into the dataset.
