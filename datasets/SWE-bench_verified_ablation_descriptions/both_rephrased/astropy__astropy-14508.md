## Task Objective
You are given a software issue description that may include both:
1. Detailed reproduction steps or executable test code, along with the expected output.
2. Executable code that triggers a runtime error, including the corresponding error message or stack trace.

Your task is to rewrite **both** portions into natural language explanations as a human developer might express them, clearly conveying the reproduction process and expected result.

- For reproduction: Describe how to trigger the issue and what the expected outcome is, without using code.
- For runtime error: Describe what kind of error occurred, when it happened, and what was observed — without including stack traces or raw exception messages.

Leave the rest of the issue description unchanged.

## Issue Description
`io.fits.Card` may use a string representation of floats that is larger than necessary

### Description

In some scenarios, `io.fits.Card` may use a string representation of floats that is larger than necessary, which can force comments to be truncated. Due to this, there are some keyword/value/comment combinations that are impossible to create via `io.fits` even though they are entirely possible in FITS.

### Expected behavior

Being able to create any valid FITS Card via `io.fits.Card`.

### How to Reproduce

1. Obtain the provided FITS file, which contains a header card with a numeric value of 0.009125 and a comment indicating “[m] radius around actuator to avoid.”
2. Read the header from that file using the standard FITS header‐reading function. You will see that the card’s stored value and comment match exactly what is in the file.
3. Next, attempt to construct a new card by supplying the same keyword, the same numeric value (0.009125), and the same comment.
4. At this point, a verification warning is emitted indicating that the card is too long and that the comment will be truncated.
5. When you inspect the newly created card’s text form, you find that the numeric value has been expanded to “0.009124999999999999” and part of the comment has been cut off to fit within the allowed length.
