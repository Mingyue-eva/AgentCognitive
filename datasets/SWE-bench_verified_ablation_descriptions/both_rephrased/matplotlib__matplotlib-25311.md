[Bug]: Unable to pickle figure with draggable legend

### Bug summary

I am unable to pickle figure with draggable legend. Same error comes for draggable annotations.

### Reproduction steps and expected outcome

On Windows 10 with Python 3.10 and Matplotlib 3.7.0 installed via pip, open a new figure and add a single subplot. Plot a series of time versus speed values, add a legend to the plot, and enable the legendâ€™s draggable feature. Then attempt to serialize the entire figure using the pickle module. The expected outcome is that pickle.dumps completes without error and the figure object is successfully serialized.

### Actual outcome

When serialization is attempted on a figure that contains a draggable legend, a TypeError is raised indicating that a FigureCanvasQTAgg object cannot be pickled.
