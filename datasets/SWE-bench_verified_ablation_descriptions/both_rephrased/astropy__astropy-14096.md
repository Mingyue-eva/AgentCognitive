Subclassed SkyCoord gives misleading attribute access message  
I'm trying to subclass SkyCoord, and add some custom properties. This all seems to be working fine, but when I have a custom property (`prop`) that tries to access a non-existent attribute (`random_attr`) below, the error message is misleading because it says `prop` doesn’t exist, where it should say `random_attr` doesn’t exist.

To reproduce the issue, define a subclass of SkyCoord that includes a property called prop which returns the value of an attribute named random_attr. Instantiate this subclass with specific right-ascension and declination values in the ICRS frame, then attempt to read the prop property. Although the code is set up to fail because random_attr does not exist, the error message reports that the prop property itself is missing.

At runtime, accessing the prop property raises an attribute error claiming that the custom property prop is not found on the instance, rather than reporting that the underlying random_attr is undefined.
