## Issue Description
Please support header rows in RestructuredText output

### Description

It would be great if the following would work:

To reproduce the issue, create a table with two columns—one called “wave” containing values of 350 nm and 950 nm, and another called “response” containing counts of 0.7 and 1.2. First, write this table to standard output in ReStructuredText format and you should see a simple grid with “wave” and “response” as headers followed by the two rows of data. Next, write the same table in fixed-width ASCII format while specifying two header rows: the first for names and the second for units. In that case, you correctly get the column names on the first header line, the units on the second header line, and then the data rows. Finally, if you try to write the table in ReStructuredText format again but also ask for those two header rows, you would expect to see the same two header lines rendered above the data in RST style.

When you make that last call, a TypeError is raised during the creation of the ReStructuredText writer. The error indicates that the writer’s initializer does not accept a parameter named “header_rows,” so the write operation fails instead of producing the expected table.

### Additional context

RestructuredText output is a great way to fill autogenerated documentation with content, so having this flexible makes the life easier `:-)`
